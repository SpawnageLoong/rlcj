# rlcj.net-template

This is effectively a fork of [dactl](https://github.com/melangue/dactl) that has been remade to work correctly with newer versions of jekyll. At time of creation, dactl's last update was 3 years ago, with most files being 7 years since last change. I couldn't get the theme to work when I forked it, so I decided to learn more aout Jekyll by slowly copy-pasting parts of dactl until something breaks, fixing the bug, and repeating. I've also made some changes to better suit my own needs.

Changes:

- Changed icomoon font to use icons from [iconify.design](https://iconify.design/)
- Add a projects page
